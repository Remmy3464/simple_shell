### Installing
Compile like this:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -g *.c -o hsh
```
The ``-g`` is for tracing Valgrind errors

## Usage
Currently, when run, it looks like this:
```
vagrant:simple_shell $ ./hsh
Dance Magic Dance
and baby says: cat main.c
#include "shell.h"

int main(void)
{
	reader();
	return(0);
}
and baby says: exit 
vagrant:simple_shell$ 
```

## Description of File Structure
1. [builtins.c](builtins.c) - Includes builtin functions: 
  * ``is_builtin()`` - checks to see if the command is a builtin, then returns a function pointer to one of the following functions:
  * ``_exit_with_grace`` - exits the shell and frees any malloc'd space.
  * ``_env()`` - prints the current environment.
  * ``_cd()`` - change pwd. Can be used without arguments. ``cd -`` takes the user to the last directory. ``cd ~`` takes the user home.
  * ``help()`` - Prints help for builtin commands.<em>Not yet built</em> 
2. [builtins_2.c](builtins_2.c) - Second file with builtin functions: 
  * ``_setenv_usr()`` - User creates or modifies an environment variable.
  * ``_unsetenv_usr()`` - User deletes an environment variable.<em>Not yet built</em>
  * ``_alias`` - Sets, modifies or prints an alias. <em>Not yet built</em>
  * ``_history`` - Prints the history. Clear history with -c flag. <em>Not yet built</em>
3. [env_operations.c](env_operations.c)
  * ``_getenv()`` - recreation of ``getenv()`` from ``<stdlib.h>``. Gets the value of the provided key. Returns NULL if not found or on error.
  * ``_unsetenv()`` - Unsets an environmental variable. <em>Not yet built. Currently, just returns the output from the standard library.</em>
  * ``_setenv()`` - Adds or modifies an environmental variable. <em>Not yet built. Currently, just returns the output from the standard library.</em>
4. [environment.c](environment.c) - Includes all functions that deal with the environment and linked lists:
  * ``list_from_path`` - creates a linked list from the PATH variable
  * ``environ_linked_list`` - creates a linked list from the ``environ`` variable. <em>Built, but is not in use yet. Still going to implement.</em>
  * ``search_os()`` - Search the absolute path provided, search current directory, or search in PATH``
5. [executor.c](executor.c) - Includes only one function that is essential to the core functionality
  * ``executor()`` - Executes a command
6. [linked_list_operations.c](linked_list_operations.c) - Includes general utilities for creating and maintaining linked lists.
  * ``add_node()`` - Adds a node to a linked list of struct type ``env_t``
  * ``free_list()`` - Frees a linked list
  * ``print_list()`` - Prints a linked list
7. [main.c](main.c) - Entry point to program, contains only the opening message and a call to the reader() function.
8. [memory_management.c](memory_management.c) - General utilities related to memory management.
  * ``_realloc`` - Recreation of ``realloc`` from ``<stdlib.h>``. Reallocates space as necessary. Currently works from smaller spaces to larger spaces, or allocates space if NULL is passed. Also sets the unitialized space to '\0'.
  * ``_memset`` - Fills a memory location with a value for n bytes. 
  * ``_memcpy`` - Copies characters from one place in memory to another for n bytes.
9. [parser.c](parser.c) - Includes all string parsing related functions, and includes functions critical to the basic functionality:
  * ``_getline()`` - Recreation of ``getline()`` from ``<stdio.h>``. Gets a line from stdin, delimited by a ``\n`` character. Also handles ``EOF``. Returns the line, or NULL on error. 
  * ``parser()`` - Parses a string into tokens. Returns a double pointer.
  * ``is_alias`` - Filler function for handling aliases. Currently does not do anything. <em> This functionality has not been built.</em>
  * global variable ``flag`` for ``signalhandler()`` - Triggers when ``^C`` is hit, then turns off.
  * `sighandler`` - Interrupts the running process if it is not a builtin then prints the prompt again.
  * ``reader()`` - Reads user input, turns it into a string and parses it into tokens. Then it performs actions based on the first token.
10. [shell.h](shell.h) - Header file: Contains all struct definitions, macros, standard library includes, and function prototypes.
11. [string_operations.c](string_operations.c) - Includes all utility functions that deal with string operations:
  * ``_strlen()`` - Returns the length of a string. Recreation of ``strlen()`` from ``<string.h>``
  * ``_strncmp()`` - Compares two strings for n bytes, and returns the value of the first difference found. Returns 0 when the last value is the same. Recreation of ``strncmp()`` from ``<string.h>``
  * ``_strdup()`` - Duplicates a string. Recreation of ``strdup()`` from ``<string.h>``
  * ``_strcat_realloc()`` - Concatenates two strings and reallocs a space if either one of the strings are too big to fit in the destination.
  * ``_atoi()`` - Turns a string into an integer. Recreation of ``atoi()`` from ``<stdlib.h>``
12. [string_operations_2.c](string_operations_2.c) - Second file that includes all utility functions that deal with string operations:
  * ``word_count()`` - Counts words in a string as delimited
  * ``_strlen_const()`` - same thing as strlen, but accepts const strings.
  * ``simple_print()`` - Writes to stdout, accepts a const string.
  * ``_isdigit()`` - Checks to see if a char is a digit. Recreation of ``isdigit()`` from ``<ctype.h>``
13. [strtok.c](strtok.c) - Includes the strtok function, as well as helper functions that do not need to be referenced elsewhere
  * ``_strchr()`` - Checks for a char in a string. Returns the string on success, and NULL on failure. Recreation of ``strchr()`` from ``<string.h>``
  * ``_strspn()`` - Gets the length of a substring. Recreation of ``strspn()`` from ``<string.h>`` with a different return type.
  * ``_strpbrk() - search a string for any set of bytes. Recreation of ``strpbrk()`` from ``<string.h>``
  * ``_strtok_r()`` - Split a string into tokens, and alters the string in the process. Recreation of ``strtok`` from ``<string.h>``
14. [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) - List of contributors.
15. [LINKS.md](LINKS.md) - List of links used for learning how to make this project.
16. [man_1_simple_shell](man_1_simple_shell) - Basic manual page.
17. [bowie](bowie.txt) - ASCII art of David Bowie.

## TODO
### Mandatory
- [x] Deal with EOF
- [x] Parser interprets ``exit`` -- Currently, if the first 4 characters of the string are ``exit``, the shell will exit. Does it need to call a function to gracefully kill all running processes and exit the program?
- [x] Deal with path
- [x] Build env function

### Advanced
- [x] ``exit`` handles arguments to exit -- What is ``exit status 4``?

#### Parser
- [x] Catch ``^C`` (CTRL + C) -- Find the signal and change its behavior.
- [ ] Handle ``;``
- [ ] Handle ``&&``, and ``||``
- [ ] Handle ``#`` Comments

#### Recreate standard library functions
- [x] getline
- [x] strtok
- [x] getenv
- [ ] setenv
- [ ] unsetenv

#### Shell Builtins
- [x] register builtins before executing commands
- [x] cd
- [ ] alias
- [x] help
- [ ] history
- [ ] Deal with variables
- [ ] Scripts as input

## Bugs
- [x] When ``enter`` is hit, it segfaults
- [x] When ``^C`` is hit, it stays on one line.
- [x] EOF (``^D``) it segfaults
- [x] Two unfreed mallocs somewhere. (Check with Valgrind.)
- [ ] Only delimiters handled are spaces and newlines.
- [ ] Optimization: Change the linked list for path to an array of strings
